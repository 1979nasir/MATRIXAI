### WEEKLY UPDATES on MATRIX SMARTCONTRACT PROJECT

11th, June - 15th, June

##### Semantic Computing


- Discuss and research on how to achieve auto extraction of contract semantics 

- Propose a high-level design on auto extraction of contract semantics based on contract CFG (Control Flow Graph)

- Employ EVM bytecode parsing framework to generate CFG and automatically extract eigenvectors, as well as execute simple tests

- Finalized a Semantic Computing blueprint which is based on contract eigenvectors, including algorithm design, third-party libraries selection, the building of developing enviromnets, etc. Semantic Computing is currently in dev phase
